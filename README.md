 This project outlines the development of an interactive tool for exploring a car accident
 dataset (USA, February 2016- March 2023). It leverages Python libraries (Pandas,
 NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data loading, cleaning, and visualization. The key
 output is a Jupyter Notebook showcasing data exploration and a Folium world map.
 The map visualizes accident locations using a color scheme (red, blue, green) to depict
 accident proneness across regions, aiding in identifying high-risk areas.
